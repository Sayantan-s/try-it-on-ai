## Start Project

If you have docker installed, just run this command ðŸš€

```bash
yarn tryitonai
```

Or, just add the envs from the `docker-compose.yml` to `.env.local` and then

```bash
yarn serve
```

**You can curl this below endpoint to see changes in the json in prod.**

```

But I'd rather suggest to try it out in the dev env of your local machine.
